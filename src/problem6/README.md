# Scoreboard API Service Module Specification

## Overview

The Scoreboard API Service handles requests related to updating and retrieving user scores for the scoreboard feature on our website. It ensures real-time updates of the top 10 user scores and implements security measures to prevent unauthorized score updates.

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for interacting with the Scoreboard API Service:

- `GET /scores`: Retrieves the top 10 user scores.
- `POST /scores/update`: Updates a user's score upon completion of an action.

## Flow of Execution

**Description**:
1. The client application triggers an action (e.g., completing a task) that increases the user's score.
2. Upon completion of the action, the client application sends a POST request to the `/scores/update` endpoint of the Scoreboard API Service, including the user's authentication token and the updated score.
3. The API service receives the request and verifies the user's authentication token to ensure authorization.
4. If the authentication token is valid, the API service updates the user's score in the database.
5. After updating the score, the API service retrieves the top 10 scores from the database.
6. The updated scoreboard data is returned to the client application as a response.

## Security Measures

To prevent malicious users from increasing scores without authorization, the Scoreboard API Service implements the following security measures:

- **Authentication**: Users must include a valid authentication token in the request to update their score. This token is generated upon user login and is verified by the API service to ensure authorization.
- **Authorization**: Only authenticated users are allowed to update their score. Unauthorized requests are rejected by the API service.

## Additional Comments for Improvement

- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a certain time period.
- **Logging**: Implement logging functionality to track API requests and responses for monitoring and debugging purposes.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling mechanisms to provide informative error messages for different scenarios, such as invalid authentication tokens or database errors.

### Conclusion

The Scoreboard API Service provides a secure and efficient solution for managing user scores on our website. By following the specified API endpoints and security measures, the backend engineering team can implement this module effectively to meet the requirements of the project.
